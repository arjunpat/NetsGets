Hello,

Please note that anything in a folder titled with a domain (ex: www.netsgets.com or portfolio.netsgets.com) folder WILL 
be uploaded onto the server when we update the server. SO, do not put anything you do not want the on the website
into a folder titled with a domain/URL.

Also, before you work, please fetch and pull. That way, we won't have conflicting code.

Thank You,

The NetsGets Team
